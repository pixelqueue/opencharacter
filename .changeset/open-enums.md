Open enums: a rules field's or a content type's enum marked `open: true` takes values from the packs that depend on its pack, listed in their rules' `extendEnums` by the enum's address (`<pack>:types.<type>.fields.<field>`, `<pack>:types.<type>.state.<key>`, `<pack>:fields.<field>`) and named in their own text under the enum's key. Loading, item fields (`invalid-item-field`), saved values, changes and `pnpm validate` see the merged list; the ruleset's `enumOrigins` names each added value's pack, which `createText` takes to name it. A bad addition is `invalid-extension`; closing an open enum (`enum-closed`) and dropping an added value (`extension-removed`) are interface changes.
